main.js

//create array called names with at least 5 items(people names)

//For loop , set to run 3 times using a person object and store the 3 results into an array called people

//  using math.random select one of the items (names) from names array to sent to constructor of ‘person’ along with the row in html which info will show

//create a function called populateHTML, which outputs persons name and job on webpage

//validation check that there is nor name repeats

//setup interval to call a runUpdate function 30 times a second.

//after all instances of person are stored in array, create FOR loop to go through each person and run a .prototype update() function, this loop should be called by a runUpdate function call in the set interval from above.


person.js

//assign person object to be a global variable using window.person = person

//create two arrays within the person object, one named jobs that contains 4 or more items(jobs), and the other named actions with a multiple number of items(actions a person might do)

//create a person constructor with 4 properties (var inside constructor) to be set inside constructor: name, action, job, and row.

//main.js writes out persons name and job, display the action in 3rd column.

// add a update() function to person object that will change the action displayed in the 3rd column every 5 seconds or so using .innerHTML to change the html
